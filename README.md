# DriveAssist

**DriveAssist** is a program which takes in a camera feed from your windshield and alerts you about various conditions.

This is the project I'm currently streaming on [Twitch].

Hopefully I can ~~copy-paste~~ reuse this code in an Android/iOS app so I don't have to sellotape a laptop to my windshield.

## Building it

You'll need [Visual Studio] (2019?) and [vcpkg] installed for that. Open the solution file, click compile and hopefully things will spring to life.

Here are the packages I think are needed:

* sdl2
* opencv
* tesseract

Whether you pick x86, x64 or ARM is up to you, your hardware and package availability.

## I Wanna Use It

See [Building it] for now... I'm planning to upload some actual executables, but not now.
